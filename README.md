Library Management System
Project Title
Library Management System using MySQL

Description
This project is a complete relational database design and implementation for a library management system using MySQL. It handles member records, books, authors, and loan transactions. The database enforces relationships and data integrity using primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints. It supports many-to-many relationships between books and authors and tracks book loans by members.

How to Run / Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git
cd library-management-system
Import the SQL file into your MySQL server:
mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < library_management.sql
The database and tables will be created with all relationships and constraints defined.

You can now run queries on the created database using any MySQL client.
